    <h1>The Antimonopoly Club is a collective of lawyers and people who build products to tackle monopolies directly: by
        creating competition.
    </h1>

    <p>
        We commit to build and litigate towards systemic change to align value creation with profit. We believe that
        anyone who
        has a good idea and can build a good product should be able to enter the market without being blocked by large
        sellers
        or buyers. We stand for the right to repair, and the right to integrate proprietary hardware with other systems.
        We want
        people everywhere to be able to save money, generate less waste, and live easier lives.
    </p>
